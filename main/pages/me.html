            <p>HI, my Name is Asher. I am currently a student at Sheridan College, enrolled in Computer Software Engineering program. </p>
            <p><h4>Why do I like programming?</h4></p>
            <p> I like porgramming because its fun and it has room for you to be creative with your ideas and gives you the freedom to make what ever you like.
                    It's like arts, you have a paint brush, paints and a canvas, you can paint whatever you want. That is why I like programming. </p>
            <p></p>
